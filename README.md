### MY EXPERIENCES:
- [**Summer Research Intern**](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/)</br> **Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur**</br>
Working closely with the senior faculty and Ph.D. scholars of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur on 'Remote Sensing' and 'Radar Interferometry' for detecting ground deformation at mining sites of the San Francisco Bay Area, CA by the application of PSInSAR (Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) technique using STUN algorithm. </br></br>
- [**Data Analysis Intern**](https://suvenconsultants.com/)</br> **Suven Consultants and Technology Pvt. Ltd**</br> 
Acquired proficiency in exploratory data analysis and scientific computation. [Visualized](https://github.com/rishabh-panda/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Finland%20Weather%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) the potential changes in hourly temperature and humidity for 10 consecutive years due to global warming corresponding to Finland, a country in the northern Europe.

### TECHNICAL COURSEWORKS AND HACKATHONS:
- [**Quantum Computing and Applications**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x7Gyp8Rsn4UD7uGcR3mIAf01MWiXrhcc/view)</br> **The Coding School**</br>
The year-long course, sponsored by [IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/) consisted of weekly LIVE lectures, lab sessions and problem sets targeted towards high school/university students, as well as working professionals in the tech-domain. The course was an exciting and first of its kind opportunity to learn the fundamentals of quantum computing, linear algebra, probability theory, quantum algorithms and its applications from MIT researchers and Oxford Quantum scientists. It is an emerging technology that will change the world as we know it. </br></br>
- [**Hackathon-1 GHF**](https://certificate.univ.ai/c/12455u23c)</br> **Geoffrey Hinton Fellowship**</br> 
GHF is a community for identifying the top talent in the country from amongst a pool of high potential Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning & Data Science enthusiasts who would like to leverage the knowledge and learning opportunities that the fellowship brings. I gained hands on experience on Data Science and acquired proficiency in handling large datasets. Geoffrey Hinton Fellows will be selected from top hackathon performers on the basis of hackathon scores followed by an interview. </br></br>
- [**Getting Started with AWS-Machine Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/YFUJFU3F6PEN?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=course)</br> **Coursera Certifications**</br> Got to know the fundamentals behind building, training and deploying a machine learning model using [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) with built-in algorithms and Jupyter Notebook instance. SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service that helps you create powerful machine learning models. With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment.</br></br>
- [**Big Data Management and Analytics**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTKLZotw1hGsTvuCaIchneMiTQDZrAUM/view)</br> **Institute of Management Studies (IMS) Ghaziabad - Business School**</br> Learnt the true definition of the term [Big Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data), the complexity present behind the traditional methods that make it difficult or near impossible to process. The act of accessing and storing large amounts of information for analytics. The challenges involved such as, managing, cleaning, analyzing and making data-driven decisions out of the data stream. Got to know the fact that the concept of big data gained momentum in the early 2000s when industry analyst Doug Laney articulated the now-mainstream definition of big data as the three V‚Äôs: Volume, Velocity and Variety.
